# Password-Generator

##Description
The purpose of this assignment is to build a password generator with Javascript.
It prompts the user to select their password criteria, then generates one accordingly.
I got a better understanding of JavaScript doing this project, but I couldn't figure out how to complete it in exactly the way I wanted to. I expect my skill will increase with time. As it is, I just barely understand what I'm doing. I did a lot of experimenting in creating my code, and I don't completely understand why some of the things I tried didn't work. But I've managed to get the thing to work, anyhow.
